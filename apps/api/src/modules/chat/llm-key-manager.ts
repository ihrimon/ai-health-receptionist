/**
 * Tracks which of the admin-configured LLM credentials (Settings page,
 * backed by LlmCredentialsService — no more .env GROQ_API_KEY) is
 * currently active, and advances forward through them in sort_order when
 * one gets rate-limited, so a caller (LlmChatClient) can keep retrying a
 * single request across keys without the user ever seeing a raw
 * rate-limit error. Each credential carries its own `model`, so this
 * also transparently rotates across different providers/models, not
 * just multiple keys for the same one.
 *
 * The credential list is re-fetched from the database on every call
 * (cheap at this project's scale) rather than cached, so an admin
 * editing Settings takes effect on the very next chat turn without a
 * restart.
 *
 * Position is tracked by credential ID, not list index — an index would
 * silently point at a *different* credential the moment an admin
 * reorders the list (same slot, different key now sitting in it), and
 * point PAST THE END the moment they delete the in-rotation credential,
 * which made getCurrentCredential() return undefined and every chat
 * turn fail immediately even with other perfectly good keys still
 * configured (confirmed live: deleting the active key broke chat
 * entirely). Tracking by ID means a reorder simply doesn't affect which
 * real credential is "active", and a delete falls back to whatever is
 * now first in the list instead of falling off the end.
 *
 * Single NestJS process, in-memory state: fine for this project's one-
 * `api`-container deployment; a multi-instance deployment would need
 * this state moved somewhere shared (e.g. Redis) to rotate in sync
 * across instances. Rotation is forward-only for the lifetime of the
 * process — once the last credential is exhausted, every further
 * request gets the "all keys exhausted" fallback until the process
 * restarts (or an admin edits Settings, since the list is re-read live
 * on every call).
