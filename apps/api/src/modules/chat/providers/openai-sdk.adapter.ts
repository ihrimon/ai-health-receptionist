/**
 * For any provider that speaks the REAL OpenAI chat-completions REST
 * convention — `POST {baseURL}/chat/completions` — namely OpenAI itself
 * and OpenAI-compatible aggregators like OpenRouter and UnoRouter.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `groq-sdk` with a `baseURL` override (that was this
 * project's earlier approach, see git history): `groq-sdk` hardcodes
 * Groq's own idiosyncratic resource path,
 * `/openai/v1/chat/completions`, in every request regardless of
 * `baseURL` — that only happens to produce the right URL because it's
 * also Groq's actual API shape (`https://api.groq.com` + that path).
 * Pointing `groq-sdk` at a different host via `baseURL` silently builds
 * a broken double-nested URL instead (confirmed empirically: UnoRouter
 * rejected a credential-validation call with
 * `Invalid URL (POST /v1/openai/v1/chat/completions)`). The real
 * `openai` package this class uses appends the standard
 * `/chat/completions` suffix with no hidden prefix, which is what every
 * other OpenAI-compatible provider actually expects — confirmed against
 * OpenRouter's and UnoRouter's own quickstart docs.
 *
 * Our canonical message/tool types (see provider-adapter.types.ts) are
 * typed against `groq-sdk`'s shape, not this package's — both implement
 * the same OpenAI chat-completions spec, so the casts at the boundaries
 * below are type-level only, not value conversions.
